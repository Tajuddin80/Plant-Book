      As temperatures rise, your garden requires extra care to stay lush and vibrant. Start with early morning watering to reduce evaporation. Apply mulch to retain soil moisture and prevent weeds. Choose heat-tolerant plants like zinnias and succulents. Provide shade using garden cloths or strategic plant placement. And finally, regularly check soil moisture and adjust your routine based on the weather forecast.

      Creating organic fertilizer at home is easier than you think. Start by collecting vegetable peels, eggshells, and coffee grounds. Mix them in a compost bin with dried leaves and garden clippings. Turn the mixture weekly to aerate. After 4â€“6 weeks, youâ€™ll have rich, crumbly compost that you can sprinkle at the base of your plants. This eco-friendly method not only saves money but also enriches the soil without chemicals.
